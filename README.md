Predicting Wildfire Causes in the USA
**Project Overview**
This project, part of the Applied Competitive Lab in Data Science course, aims to predict the causes of wildfires in the United States using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of wildfire occurrences, we seek to develop a model that can accurately identify the causes of wildfires, thereby enhancing fire management and prevention strategies.

**Dataset**
Source: Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD)
Time Range: 1992 - 2015
Size: 1.88 million records, covering 140 million acres burned
Features: Discovery date, final fire size, fire location, statistical cause code, and more

**Objective**
Goal: Develop a model to predict the cause of wildfires, optimizing the weighted ROC AUC score for all classes using a One vs Rest approach.
Metrics: Focus on maximizing the weighted ROC AUC score for classification across multiple causes.
